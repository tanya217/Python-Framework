# Python-Framework
Python is the third most popular language, as of December 2018. However, the syntax errors in python are cryptic. In some cases, python produces error messages such as "Syntax Error: invalid syntax". Lot of time and effort is spent by programmers in fixing errors in a program. We propose a novel technique that can be incorporated into the standard python IDLE that allows programmers to identify multiple syntax errors in a program, at once. The error messages displayed are descriptive making it easier for the programmer to rectify the errors. This framework identifies the compile time syntax errors in a program based on rules provided. Using these rules we generate a Python Lex and Yacc(PLY) program to identify the errors. As the PLY program is generated by another program, the framework is language independent. As a proof of concept, we developed the framework to identify errors for both Python and C.
